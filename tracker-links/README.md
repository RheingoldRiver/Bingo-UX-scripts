Copy this into [/u/shift_shaper's interactive tracker](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1joyvo9/interactive_bingo_card_2025/) on the Data tab if you want:

1. Go to "View"
2. Hidden Sheets
3. Show Data
4. Copy-paste the text from `links.txt` file into column G, `usefulURL`. A couple of the cells might have some [slightly different formatting](https://i.imgur.com/UXC4uB7.png), don't worry about this.
